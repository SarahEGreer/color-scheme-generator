# Color Scheme Generator

#### View Live Application: https://sarahs-color-scheme-generator.netlify.app/

## Overview
Application generates a color scheme from The Color API based on the user-selected color.

## Purpose of Project
This project was an assignment on the [Scrimba Front End Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). I was provided the Figma file and the instructions to use The Color API to create a color scheme generator. Our stretch goal was to have the HEX labels copy to the user's clipboard upon clicking them, which I was able to accomplish. The original project did not include a mobile version, however, as I am interested in responsive design, I chose to include one.
